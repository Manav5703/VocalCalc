# VocalCalc

VocalCalc is a Voice-Activated Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using voice commands. This application processes voice input to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while providing both visual and audible feedback.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic using voice commands:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Handles error cases such as division by zero and invalid commands.
- Voice recognition using Pythonâ€™s `SpeechRecognition` library.
- Provides audio feedback using the `pyttsx3` library.
- Simple graphical user interface built with `PyQt5`.

## Example Commands
- "What is 5 plus 3?"
- "Subtract 10 from 7."
- "Multiply 3 by 4."
- "Divide 30 by 5."

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For voice input processing.
- **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech feedback.
- **PyQt5**: For the graphical user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manav5703/VocalCalc.git
