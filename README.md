# VocalCalc

VocalCalc is a Voice-Activated Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using voice commands. This application processes voice input to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while providing both visual and audible feedback.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic using voice commands:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Handles error cases such as division by zero and invalid commands.
- Performs scientific calculations:
  - Trigonometric functions.
  - Logarithmic, square root, cube root, and power.
- Voice recognition using Pythonâ€™s `SpeechRecognition` library.
- Provides audio feedback using the `pyttsx3` library.
- Simple graphical user interface built with `tkinter`.

## Example Commands
- "What is 5 plus 3?"
- "Subtract 10 from 7."
- "What is cosine 45?"
- "What is cube root of 81?"

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For voice input processing.
- **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech feedback.
- **tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
